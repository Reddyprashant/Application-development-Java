# Application-development-Java
There are volunteers who are looking to help people and there are people seeking help from volunteers but there is no centralized system to connect both.

Purpose of this project is to provide an efficient way of mapping volunteering groups or individuals to aid requesters.
We will have a centralized system where different companies, people or NGO's interested in volunteering work or providing aid can input the information. The homeless shelters, schools or other aid requesting institute can raise their requests. This application helps in mapping and will help the people in need in a larger scale. Having this kind of application will encourage people to volunteer.
Tagging the homeless people and reporting to nearest organization.
